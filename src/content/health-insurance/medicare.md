## Medicare Insurance Coverage

Medicare is a federal health insurance program that provides healthcare coverage to eligible individuals, primarily those who are 65 years or older, as well as some younger individuals with disabilities or specific health conditions. Medicare is divided into several parts, each covering different aspects of healthcare services.

### Medicare Parts

#### Part A: Hospital Insurance

- Covers inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility care, hospice care, and some home health care
- Most people do not have to pay a premium for Part A if they or their spouse paid Medicare taxes while working

#### Part B: Medical Insurance

- Covers certain doctors' services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventive services
- Requires a monthly premium, which can be deducted from your Social Security benefits or paid directly

#### Part C: Medicare Advantage Plans

- Offered by private insurance companies approved by Medicare
- Includes both Part A and Part B coverage, and often provides additional benefits such as prescription drug coverage (Part D), dental, vision, and hearing services
- Plans may have lower out-of-pocket costs compared to Original Medicare (Part A and B)

#### Part D: Prescription Drug Coverage

- Helps cover the cost of prescription drugs
- Run by private insurance companies approved by Medicare
- Available as a standalone plan or as part of a Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C)

### Eligibility and Enrollment
